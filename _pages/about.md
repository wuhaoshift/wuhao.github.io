Hiya, I’m Hao WU, and you can call me Quentin. In ancient Rome, it symbolized the **number five**. In sound, it mirrors my name. I was born in 2000 and identify as an ENFP. I’m currently seeking Ph.D. and MPhil opportunities. I earned my **B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT)** in June 2024. After graduation, I worked for six months as a Research Technical Assistant in the ***[AIMS Lab under Prof. Hailong Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/hailong-huang/home)*** at the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering(AAE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(PolyU). I was later directly recruited by ***[Academician Dayong Jin](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=119&p=teacher)*** to join the Eastern Institute of Technology as an engineer.My research interests include **robotics, organoid intelligence, UAVs, and autonomous vehicles**.

I’m also one of the leading experts and collectors of ancient Chinese coins in mainland China. I began studying this field at the age of six and have spent the past decade developing into a **top-level authentication specialist**. Over the years, I’ve served as a chief consultant or authenticator for several of China’s leading coin grading and auction companies, including **[GBCA (Gongbo)](https://www.gongbocoins.com/)***, **[Baocui Grading](https://www.baocuicoin.com/)**, **[Zhizhen Grading](https://www.baocuicoin.com/view/4.html)**, and **[Yuequanwan Antiques Auction House](https://wwj.beijing.gov.cn/bjww/362771/362775/325842777/index.html)**
.
To support myself, I’ve also engaged in limited coin trading. In recent years, my focus has been on the collection and study of Qing Dynasty coin prototypes, including diaomu**雕母** (engraving samples&mother coins' mother coin), muqian**母钱** (mother coins), and yangqian**样钱** (pattern coins). I’m always open to discussion and exchange with fellow collectors and those interested in this field.
